# Web Infrastructure Module

This course is part of my journey to understanding and mastering the critical components of modern web infrastructure. Here, I'll document my projects, experiments, and key learnings as I dive into topics that power today's web systems.

## Introduction & Module Overview
This module aims to build a strong foundation in web infrastructure by exploring both theory and hands-on practice. Throughout this course, I'll be learning and working on:

- **Python API Development:**  
  I'll design, implement, and consume RESTful APIs from basic to advanced concepts, learning best practices for scalability and maintainability.

- **SSH:**  
  Master secure connections to remote servers, including key management and authentication, while also using SSH for remote debugging and troubleshooting.

- **Web Servers:**  
  I will learn about web servers like Nginx, how to configure them and how to manage server modules and virtual hosts.

- **Load Balancers:**  
  Discovering techniques to distribute traffic effectively, I'll explore various load-balancing algorithms to improve scalability and performance.

- **HTTPS/SSL:**  
  Securing web traffic is critical—I'll study encryption, digital certificates, and SSL configuration to ensure secure communications.

- **Firewalls:**  
  Gain insights into network security by learning how to configure and manage firewalls, protecting infrastructure from unauthorized access.

- **Debugging Techniques:**  
  Troubleshooting is key! I’ll apply tools and methodologies to diagnose and resolve performance issues and configuration errors in web infrastructure stacks.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, I expect to:

- Understand the role and architecture of web infrastructure in modern web development.
- Build and manage Python APIs using industry-standard practices.
- Securely connect to and administer remote servers via SSH.
- Configure, deploy, and maintain web servers and load balancers.
- Implement HTTPS/SSL for secure data transmission.
- Set up firewalls and enforce robust security policies.
- Employ effective debugging strategies to optimize web systems.

## My Approach

This repository is a reflection of my hands-on approach to learning. Expect to see:
- **Project Walkthroughs:** Detailed explanations and code samples.
- **Case Studies:** Real-world examples to apply theoretical concepts.
- **Experiment Logs:** My personal notes and reflections on what works (and what doesn’t).
